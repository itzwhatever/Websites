      <h1>Xiaolongbao - 小笼包</h1>
      <img src="Dumplings-Xiao Long Bao.jpg" width="400" height="250" class="center">
      <p>This dish can be both a bun and dumpling. This dish is also known as the Shanghai Dumpling however the translation is a little steamed bun. It is usually stuffed with pork but can be stuffed with other types of meat and vegetables. What makes this dish like a dumpling is it contains broth. The broth makes the Xiao Long Bao very moist causing it to be a dumpling. It is really difficult to find this dish at dim sum restaurants. If you want to try this dish we recommend going to a dumpling restaurant.

      <p>Overall there are many types of dumplings. Dumplings can be made either steamed or fried. Dumplings have many fillings that there is certainly something for you.</p>
