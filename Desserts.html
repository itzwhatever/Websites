      <p>There are many desserts served at Dim Sum but we will only review the most popular desserts that can be found at every restaurant.

      <br>
      
      <h1>Egg Tarts - 蛋撻</h1>

      <br>
      
   <p>  Egg tart is a dessert that everyone loves no matter what age you are. The yolk is creamy, smooth and sweet. The tart is baked, the tart becomes very crunchy and flakey. Dim Sum restaurants are the best places to get egg tarts. The crusts are made perfect while the crust at Chinese bakeries is not as flakey. When you go to Dim Sum we highly recommend getting egg tarts. It is a perfect dessert to go along with your tea and perfect from all the savoury food. </p>
      <br>
      <h1>Mango Pudding</h1>
      <br>

      <br>
      
      <p>Mango Pudding is a dessert served at Dim Sum and sometimes at Chinese dinners. The mango pudding is made with real mangos and is served with evaporated milk. We recommend eating the pudding with milk. Without the milk the pudding is bland. The pudding can be shaped into different shapes. At Dim Sum, they are usually shaped into hearts but at fancier restaurants, they are shaped into fishes. </p>

      <h1>Tofu Pudding - 豆腐花</h1>
      <br>
      <img src="Desserts-Tofu Pudding.jpg" width="300" height="300" class="center">
      <p>The tofu pudding is a steamed dessert. Tofu Pudding is made of silky tofu and sugar syrup. It is smooth, silky and sweet. This dish can be served both cold and warm. Traditionally the Tofu Pudding is served in a wooden basket to keep the tofu warm.</p>
