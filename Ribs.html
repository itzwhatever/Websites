        <p>There are two main types of ribs served at Dim Sum. On this page you will learn about the beef ribs and the pork ribs.</p>
        
        <h1>Pork Ribs 排骨</h1>
        <img src="Ribs-Pork Ribs.jpg" class="center" height="300">
        <p>Pork ribs are one of the most popular dishes at restaurants and are made in all Dim Sum restaurants. This dish is made with bones from different parts of the pork. It is steamed and then garnished with fermented beans, garlic, and chili peppers. Some dim sum restaurants offer "Pork Ribs with Rice" where the steamed pork ribs are served on white rice.
        </p>
        <h1>Beef Ribs</h1>
        <img src="Ribs-Beef Ribs.jpg"class="center" width="300" height="400" >
        <p>The beef ribs are different from the pork ribs. Depending on how the restaurant makes this dish, it can be made both steamed or pan-fried. The steamed version tastes very similar to the pork ribs while the pan-fried version is the better version in our opinion with nice burn marks. The meat it juicier and is marinated differently. The marination is more salty and sweet than the steamed ribs. Another difference is the beef ribs have more meat and less bone than the pork ribs. </p>
