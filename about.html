          The History Of Spencer's Food Reviews
        </h2>
        <p>
          Spencer's Food Reviews has been running since 2014. What started as a project at school became the blog you know today. Spencer's school project was really successful and with the help of some teachers, "The Restaurant of The Month" segment of the project was featured in the school newspaper. Subsequent, a parent approached Spencer and him to become a writer for the Toronto Star.  The Toronto Star gave Spencer's Food Review a platform. From there, more opportunities emerged. In 2018, Katrina became the co-owner of Spencer's Food Reviews. The co-owners decided to create a website so they can constantly update their followers with content. The blog became a success and we hope to continue to provide our followers with new content every week.
